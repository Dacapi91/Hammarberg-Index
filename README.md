# Hammarberg-Index

This repository contains the implementation the Hammarberg Index following the instructions and making adaptations from
the original article [1]. This index value is applied in speech signals and is related to the vocal effort reflected in the
spectral information. It is a spectral slope measurements and can be used as a feature in emotionally expressive speech.
The Hammarberg Index is defined as the intensity difference [in dB] between the maximum intensity in a
lower frequency band [0–2000 Hz] versus a higher frequency band [2000–5000 Hz] [2]
